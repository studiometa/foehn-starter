/**
 * A settings screen under Appearance, on the WordPress Settings API.
 *
 * `settings()` says what is stored; the template says what the form looks like.
 * That separation is the whole difference from an ACF options page, which
 * declares both — and the reason there is no field builder here. Text inputs
 * and checkboxes are a day's work; repeaters, conditional logic and media
 * pickers are ACF's actual product.
 *
 * The form is Twig, like every other view in a Føhn theme, and this class has
 * no PHP of its own beyond the declaration. Everything around the fields — the
 * heading, the form, the nonce, the submit button — comes from the framework,
 * so a page cannot forget the one piece whose absence makes saving fail
 * silently.
